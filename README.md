# Battlefield 1 Multiplayer Hack

Written in assembly and injected into the game's process, this hack features a small FOV aimbot, enemy outline chams, enemies on minimap, enemy gadget icons, and anti-screenshot circumvention for FairFight anti-cheat.

In the source code, all memory offsets have been redacted to neutralize the cheat. It's not available publicly or otherwise. This is simply a demonstration of memory manipulation.

In this video, I am playing against (at the time) one of the top U.S. players, Spanx87 who was live streaming on Twitch with his friends. All of the voices were from his Twitch stream. I was not using a microphone.
