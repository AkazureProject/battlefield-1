# Battlefield 1 Multiplayer Hack

Written in assembly and injected into the game's process, this hack features a small FOV aimbot, enemy outline chams with occlusion detection/coloring, enemy minimap icons, enemy gadget icons, and anti-screenshot circumvention for FairFight anti-cheat. The anti-screenshot code toggles off all the features in time to return a clean screenshot to the FairFight server. FairFight can detect traditional aimbots and other types of cheating that causes superhuman feats. This cheat was never detected during months of use.

In the source code, all memory offsets have been redacted to neutralize the cheat. It's not available publicly or otherwise. This is simply a demonstration of memory manipulation.

In this video, I was playing against (at the time) one of the top U.S. players, Spanx87, who was live streaming on Twitch with his friends. All voices were from his Twitch stream. I was not using a microphone. I was randomly placed in a match, saw a player name containing "Twitch," Googled the player name, found his live stream, and recorded everything while playing.
